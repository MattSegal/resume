        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <h3 class="employer-title">Expense Check</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">Frontend Developer - 2019 - 6 months</p>
        <p>
          I worked as the primary front end developer for an online insurance
          start-up for a fixed-term period. I used the React / Redux / Router
          stack. Upon starting, I quickly cleared out the work-in-progress to
          enable the first release in several months. After that, I sped up the
          release cycle to allow weekly releases by assisting the business in
          breaking work into small valuable chunks, while also improving the
          stability of the existing codebase to minimise operational risk. I
          introduced static typing with FlowJS, production error reporting with
          Sentry, unit tests and automated code-formatting.

          Software Developer and Technical Advisor - 2019 - 6 months (ongoing)
        </p>
        <p>
          I volunteer for <a href="https://anikalegal.com">Anika Legal</a>, a
          charitable Victorian start-up that is seeking to provide better access
          to justice. I have helped Anika by analysing their business
          requirements and assisting them in making technology choices to suit
          their needs. In addition, I have implemented a client-intake system,
          setup analytics and assisted them with their marketing efforts.

        <h3 class="employer-title">Stocks Digital</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">Senior Software Developer - 2018 - 12 months</p>
        <p>
          At StocksDigital I worked in a small team of developers to support an
          online content-marketing business. In the role, I migrated a legacy
          WordPress website, including thousands of articles and images, to a
          new Wagtail based CMS. I built a publishing interface for our writing
          team, as well as an automated reporting tool for our hundreds of
          clients. My work included a React frontend, a Django backend, our AWS
          infrastructure and our analytics.
        </p>

        <h3 class="employer-title">Kogan.com</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">Software Developer - 2017 - 8 months</p>
        <p>
          At Kogan I worked on the Kogan.com website. My work included front end
          development in React, back-end development with Django (Python) and
          our DevOps practices. In addition to my technical work, I also
          regularly liaised with stakeholders in marketing and operations to
          ensure that I shipped code that met the business' needs.
        </p>

        <h3 class="employer-title">eNett International</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">Software Developer - 2016 - 1 year</p>
        <p>
          I worked on eNett's online-payment web services. In this role I
          adopted a new tech stack (.NET/SQL Server) and did software
          maintenance in the production support team. At eNett I took an
          interest in our DevOps practices, including our configuration
          managment (PowerShell DSC) and continuous integration pipeline
          (Jenkins). Another key feature of my time at eNett was my drive to
          improve our internal documentation of both our architecture and
          business logic
        </p>

        <h3 class="employer-title">Wood and Grieve Engineers</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">Acoustic Consultant - 2014 - 9 months</p>
        <p>
          At WGE I conducted acoustic assessments for the building industry. I
          worked in a team of 4 consultants. I conducted assessments of the
          impact of outdoor industrial and road traffic noise on residential
          buildings. I documented my assessments in technical reports, which
          were usually read by local councils. I explained my findings to
          architects and project managers via written communication and
          presentations.

      <div id="front-end" class="section">
        <h2>Front-End Development</h2>
        <p>
          I create stateful, single page JavaScript apps using React / Redux /
          Router. I've used SASS, styled components, and Storybook. I write unit
          tests using Jest and Enzyme. I'm comfortable manging my own build
          process, and deploying the front-end as an independent static site.

      <div id="back-end" class="section">
        <h2>Back-End Development</h2>
        <p>
          I have worked with back-end Python professionally for 3 years. My
          typical stack is Django / Postgres / Redis / Celery. I write unit
          tests with PyTest, use version control and thoroughly document my work
          when it is important to share.

      <div id="devops" class="section">
        <h2>DevOps</h2>
        <p>
          I implemented DevOps tooling and processes to speed up iteration time
          and reduce operational risk. I can deploy everything I write to
          production using automated CI/CD, containers and config management
          tools such as Ansible. I am comfortable using AWS and provisioning new
          infrastructure.
