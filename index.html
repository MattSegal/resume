        <div id='back-end' class='section'>
            <h1>Back-End Development</h1>
            <p>I am a confident back-end web developer: I don't mind what tools I use as long as I'm working on something interesting, but my go-to tools are:</p>

            <h1>DevOps</h1>
            <p>
                I am interested in DevOps because good practices speed up iteration time and minimize developer pain-points.
            </p>
            <p>Tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scripting (bash, Python, Powershell)</li>
                <li>CI and CD (Jenkins, BuildKite)</li>
                <li>Containers (Docker, Docker Swarm, AWS ECS)</li>
                <li>Web server admin (nginx, apache2, IIS)</li>
                <li>Config managment (Ansible, Saltstack, Powershell DSC)</li>
                <li>Server observability (Sentry, NewRelic, SumoLogic, Papertrail)</li>
                <li>Database setup and admin (Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL)</li>
                <li>AWS (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFormation, CloudWatch)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I strongly believe in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reproducible test environments (dev / test / prod)</li>
                <li>Automated continuous integration (unit tests, linting)</li>
                <li>Automated deployment</li>
                <li>Automated backups</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Work Experience</h1>
            <h2 class='employer-title'>Stocks Digital</h2>
            <p class='subtitle'>Senior Software Developer - 2018 - 12 months</p>
            <p>
                At StocksDigital I worked in a small team of developers to support an online content marketing business. While working in the role, I migrated a legacy WordPress website, including thousands of articles and images, to a new Wagtail based CMS. I also built a publishing interface for our writing team, as well as an automated reporting tool for our hundreds of clients.
            </p>

            <h2 class='employer-title'>Kogan.com</h2>
            <p class='subtitle'>Software Developer - 2017 - 8 months</p>
            <p>
                At Kogan I worked on the development team, which is responsible for the Kogan.com website. My work there was full stack - it included front end development in ReactJS, back-end development with Django (Python) and our DevOps practices. In addition to my technical work, I also regularly liased with stakeholders in marketing and operations to ensure that I shipped code that met the business' needs.
            </p>

            <h2 class='employer-title'>eNett International</h2>
            <p class='subtitle'>Software Developer - 2016 - 1 year</p>
            <p>
                I was back-end .NET developer at eNett International, which provides online-payment web services. I quickly adopted a new tech stack (.NET/SQL Server) and worked on software maintenance in the production support team. As a part of the prod support team I read a *lot* of code, implemented tactical bugfixes and enhancements, and participated in code reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                I became one of the in-office experts on our DevOps practices, including our configuration managment (PowerShell DSC) and continuous integration pipeline (Jenkins). Another key feature of my time at eNett was my drive to improve our internal documentation of both our architecture and business logic.

            <h2 class='employer-title'>Wood and Grieve Engineers</h2>
            <p class='subtitle'>Acoustic Consultant - 2014 - 9 months</p>
            <p>
                At WGE I conducted acoustic assessments for the building industry. I worked in a team of 4 consultants. I conducted assessments of the impact of outdoor industrial and road traffic noise on residential buildings. I documented my assessments in technical reports, which were usually read by local councils. I explained my findings to architects and project managers via written communication and presentations.
