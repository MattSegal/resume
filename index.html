          stack. Upon starting, I quickly cleared out the work-in-progress to
          enable the first release in several months. After that, I sped up the
          release cycle to allow weekly releases by assisting the business in
          breaking work into small valuable chunks, while also improving the
          stability of the existing codebase to minimise operational risk. I
          introduced static typing with FlowJS, production error reporting with
          Sentry, unit tests and automated code-formatting.
