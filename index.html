            <p class='subtitle'>Software Developer - 2017 - 8 months</p>
            <p>
                At Kogan I worked on the development team, which is responsible for the Kogan.com website. My work there was full stack - it included front end development in ReactJS, back-end development with Django (Python) and our DevOps practices. In addition to my technical work, I also regularly liased with stakeholders in marketing and operations to ensure that I shipped code that met the business' needs.

            <h2 class='employer-title'>eNett International</h2>
            <p class='subtitle'>Software Developer - 2016 - 1 year</p>
            <p>
                I was back-end .NET developer at eNett International, which provides online-payment web services. I quickly adopted a new tech stack (.NET/SQL Server) and worked on software maintenance in the production support team. As a part of the prod support team I read a *lot* of code, implemented tactical bugfixes and enhancements, and participated in code reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                I became one of the in-office experts on our DevOps practices, including our configuration managment (PowerShell DSC) and continuous integration pipeline (Jenkins). Another key feature of my time at eNett was my drive to improve our internal documentation of both our architecture and business logic.

            <p class='subtitle'>Acoustic Consultant - 2014 - 9 months</p>
            <p>
                At WGE I conducted acoustic assessments for the building industry. I worked in a team of 4 consultants. I conducted assessments of the impact of outdoor industrial and road traffic noise on residential buildings. I documented my assessments in technical reports, which were usually read by local councils. I explained my findings to architects and project managers via written communication and presentations.
