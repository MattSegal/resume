        <p class="subtitle">Software Engineer - 2024 to present</p>
        <p>
          At Montauk Labs I build and maintain microservices for AI-powered adtech products.
          I have deployed two FastAPI services with Terraform on AWS ECS. I've built a
          high-throughput service that serves LLM classifications to power client-side adtech,
          handling 800 requests per second. I've also iteratively built a service to recommend
          content to advertisers using LLMs and embedding based search. I replatformed our Dagster
          ETL system to run on AWS ECS with greater reliability and cost efficiency. I built and run our
          in-house LLM evaluation framework. I work autonomously in a flat-organisation, working
          closely with my colleagues to ensure robust integration of our internal services.

          start-up for a fixed-term period. I used the React / Redux / Router
          stack. Upon starting, I quickly cleared out the work-in-progress to
          enable the first release in several months. After that, I sped up the

          breaking work into small valuable chunks, while also improving the
          stability of the existing codebase to minimise operational risk. I
          introduced static typing with FlowJS, production error reporting with
          Sentry, unit tests and automated code-formatting.
