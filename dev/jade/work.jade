				As an acoustic engineer I provided acoustic assessments for developers and councils in the building industry.brI assessed the impact of commercial sound sources on residences by conducting noise surveys and assessing the data. I engaged in computer modelling of outdoor industrial noise sources and indoor listening spaces.brI have developed insight into the building industry by liaising with developers, architects and other engineers to produce compliant acoustic designs.

				I have spent five winters at Mt Buller teaching a wide cross section of the population to ski, instructing children as young as 3 to adults in their 50s. This experience has enabled me to explain concepts clearly, lead groups and speak publicly with confidence. In my last two years I had the pleasure of coaching freestyle skiing with a group of teens, where I was responsible for their safety and technical development.
