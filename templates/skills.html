In my role as an acoustic engineer I have presented technical acoustic information to non-technical stakeholders such as architects and property developers.</p></div><br/><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Learning	</div><p class="edu-blurb">I am actively and enthusiastically learning more about web design and development, as well as software development in general.
I am interested in improving my skills in both front end web development, back end services, machine learning and computer science in general.
I am committed to continuously learning in my own time.
I am able to autonomously pick up new concepts and technology and apply them to the project at hand. </p></div><br/><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Personable	</div><p class="edu-blurb">I am a cool dude</p></div></div><div id="python" class="panel"><h1>Python</h1><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Data Analysis	</div><p class="edu-blurb">I have used the Numerical Python (NumPy) and Python for Data Analysis (pandas) modules to store and manipulate data in my Poker Bot and other applications. 
I find these tools are great for image manipulation and numerical computing.</p></div><br/><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Unit testing</div><p class="edu-blurb">I use the py.test unit-testing framework to keep my python code functional. 
I have most recently written tests for my <a href="https://github.com/MattSegal/logistic-regression/blob/master/test_log_reg.py">logistic regression module</a>. </p></div><br/><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Graphical User Interfaces </div><p class="edu-blurb">I have used the Tkinter GUI module in my Poker Bot and Python Script manager projects.</p></div><br/><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Online Course Assignments		</div><p class="edu-blurb">I have used Python to complete online auto-graded assigments. In these assignments I have implemented algorithms such as depth-first-search, MergeSort and minmax. I have also use Python to attack <a href="https://github.com/MattSegal/discrete-optimisation/tree/master/knapsack%20problem">NP-hard problems such as the knapsack problem </a>and the graph coloring problem.</p></div></div><div id="front-end-web-dev" class="panel"><h1>Front End Web Development</h1><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">JavaScript and jQuery	</div><p class="edu-blurb">I can use JavaScript to animate web-pages, render dynamic content and call on back-end APIs with AJAX requests.
I can use jQuery to assist with DOM manipulation and Mustache.js to render HTML templates. 
I have used JavaScript to create a <a href="/links/">single-page app </a>and an <a href="/sort/">algorithm visualizer </a>using a hand-rolled MVC structure.
I am happy working in vanilla Javascript, but I look forward to picking up a front end framework such as React. </p></div><br/><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Web Design	</div><p class="edu-blurb">I enjoy designing user-interfaces and I try to make them aesthetic and intuitive.
I am comfortable writing a webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS.
I currently use SASS and Jade and I love their clean syntax.
I have implemented responsive designs in <a href="/links/"> Matt's Links </a>and my <a href="/">landing page</a>. 	
I am familliar with using Chrome Developer Tools to inspect and debug page layouts.</p></div><br/><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Meta-Tools	</div><p class="edu-blurb">I use gulp to compile my SASS and Jade into CSS and HTML respectively.
I enjoy learning new ways to simplify and automate my workflow.
</p></div><p></p></div><div id="back-end-web-dev" class="panel"><h1>Back End Web Development</h1><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Flask (Python)</div><p class="edu-blurb">I have used Flask to run a local server on my machine for development and have deployed it to a live webserver (mattsegal.xyz). 
Using Flask I have implemented HTML templating and a RESTful API for Matt's Links.
I like Flask's simplicity and forgiving learning curve.</p></div><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Ruby on Rails</div><p class="edu-blurb">I am currently using Rails to implement a back-end app that will allow users to buy someone a gift as a group online. 
As a relative beginner I find Rails' opinionated configuration to be helpful and the documentation is excellent.
I can use Rails to create data models, implement controller logic and serve templated views to users. I love the Rails testing framework and I have used it to write unit and integration tests.</p></div><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Web Server Administration</div><p class="edu-blurb">I host my web projects on a DigitalOcean server  running Ubuntu which I have set up from the Linux command 	line via SSH. To operate the server I have installed and configured Apache2 and uploaded my files via FTP.	</p></div></div><div id="misc" class="panel"><h1>Other Technical Skills</h1><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">SQL 	</div><p class="edu-blurb">I have used SQL in personal projects to store and access data. I have deployed MySQL on a webserver to store user data for a Flask-based RESTful API. 
I am familiar with SQL syntax.  </p></div><br/><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Git</div><p class="edu-blurb">I use the git command line to back-up personal projects and push them to GitHub. I can use branch and merge to keep the master branch of a project stable.</p></div><br/><div class="edu-item"><div class="edu-item">Future Work	</div><p class="edu-blurb">I am currently developing a Rails app to allow users to buy a gift for a friend as a group. 
I am also interested in picking up a front-end framework such a React.
In the long term I endeavour continue my study of both computer science and web development.</p></div></div></div>
